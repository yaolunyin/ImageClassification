# Image Classification

This project takes small images (32*32) and identifies what object is in them. Some examples of small pictures are CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)
I used a pre-trained VGG16 model with some modifications. The key component of my project is the convolutional layer. 

Result:
Accuracy: 0.69
